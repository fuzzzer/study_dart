// Here's an example of how to write a simple program in Dart:

void main() {
  print("Hello, World!");
}
// This is the classic "Hello, World!" program, which simply prints the message "Hello, World!" 
//to the console. Here's a breakdown of the code:
// void main() is the entry point of the program. This is where
// the program starts execution.
// print("Hello, World!") is a function that takes a string as 
//input and prints it to the console. In this case, it prints the message
// "Hello, World!".
// To run this program, you can use an Dart compiler, or an integrated 
//development environment (IDE) like Android Studio that has Dart support. 
//You can also run it using an online Dart compiler.
// This is just a simple example, but it should give you an idea of how
// to write a basic program in Dart. You can build on this example to create 
//more complex programs as you gain more experience and knowledge.
