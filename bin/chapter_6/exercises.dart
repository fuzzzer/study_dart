// 1. Write an anonymous function that takes two parameters (a and b) and returns their sum. Call this function and print the result.

// 2. Write a function that takes two positional parameters (a and b),
//    and one named parameter "operation" with a default value of "add". If "operation" is "add", return the sum of a and b, and if "operation" is "subtract", return the difference of a and b. Call this function with different arguments to test it.

// 3. Write a lambda that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.
//     Call this lambda and print the result.

// 4. Write a closure that returns a function that takes a parameter and returns the square of that parameter.
//     Call this closure and assign the returned function to a variable. Then call that variable with different
//     arguments to test it.

// 5. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a lambda that multiplies each
//     integer in the list by a given factor. Call this function with a list of integers and a factor,
//      and then call the returned lambda with the same list to test it.

// 6. Write a function that takes a list of integers and a lambda, and returns a list of integers where each integer
//     is multiplied by the result of the lambda. Call this function with a list of integers and a lambda that returns
//       a random number between 1 and 10, and print the resulting list.

// 7. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a closure that maintains a running total
//      of the sum of the integers. Call this closure multiple times with different lists of integers and print
//       the resulting running totals.
