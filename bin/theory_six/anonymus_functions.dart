// An anonymous function in Dart is a function that has no name and can be assigned to a variable.
// It can be passed as an argument to another function or assigned to a callback. Here's an example:

void main() {
  Function addNumbers = (int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  };

  int result = addNumbers(5, 10);
  print(result);
}

// In this example, we create an anonymous function that adds two numbers and assigns it to the variable addNumbers.
// We then call this function with the arguments 5 and 10 and assign the result to the variable result.
// Finally, we print the value of result to the console.

// Anonymous functions can also be used as callbacks. Here's an example:

void example() {
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  numbers.forEach((int number) {
    print(number);
  });
}

// In this example, we have a list of numbers and we use the forEach method to iterate over each number.
// The forEach method takes an anonymous function as an argument, which is called for each element in the list.
// In this case, the anonymous function simply prints the number to the console.
